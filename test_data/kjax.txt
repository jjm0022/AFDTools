.Near Term.../through Friday/...

High pressure will move to the northeast tonight through Friday. An
inverted trough is expected to develop over the coastal waters
overnight, which will strengthen during the day Friday. This trough
could result in a few showers near the coast, but most of this
activity is expected to remain offshore. An area of low pressure
will also gather along the central gulf coast Friday afternoon, with
its associated warm front extending east toward SE GA.

Temperatures will be near normal tonight, then above normal for
Friday.

&&

.Short Term.../Friday night through Monday/...

The forecast area will be between an inverted trough over the
coastal waters and an area of low pressure to the west Friday night.
A weak frontal boundary will extend between these two systems, but
high pressure centered to the north will minimize the effect of this
boundary, and largely push it to the south, but a few showers will
be possible. The eastern inverted trough will move away to the east
on Saturday, as the western low gets a little closer with an
associated frontal boundary stretching across NE FL. High pressure
will ridge into the area from the north Saturday, which will limit
precipitation chances near the front. The ridge is expected to
strengthen to the north Saturday night, then weaken and move
northeast Sunday into Monday, while a weakening wave will be located
to the west. While passing showers can not be ruled out Sunday into
Monday, the chance will be low.

Temperatures will trend above normal this period.

&&

.Long Term.../Monday night through Thursday/...

High pressure will be to the east Monday night into Tuesday. Long
range models diverge on timing of next frontal system, which will
arrive in the Tuesday to Tuesday night timeframe. At this point,
will favor average of solutions, with an arrival of weakening front
Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday evening, passing to southeast by
Wednesday morning, with strong high pressure building to the
northwest behind it. The high is expected to build to the north
Wednesday into Thursday, with resultant onshore flow producing
potential for mainly coastal showers.

Temperatures will trend above normal into Tuesday, then below normal
for Wednesday and near to above normal for Thursday.

.Marine...

High pressure will move to the northeast through Friday, as an
inverted trough develops over the coastal waters. This trough will
move to the east Friday night into Saturday, as a ridge builds
from the north. High pressure will be to the north Saturday night
into Sunday, as another inverted trough develops over the coastal
waters. High pressure will build to the east Monday night into
Tuesday. A cold front will move through from the northwest Tuesday
into Tuesday night.

Rip Currents: Low Risk through Friday.
