Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Glasgow MT

.DISCUSSION...
Current cold airmass will move to our east tonight with a surface
high pressure cell. A fairly large storm system off the Pacific NW
coast will be our main weather maker through the weekend as it
slowly drifts east. It will induce an upper ridge ahead of it,
bringing a warmer than normal airmass to the area Friday and
Saturday. Expect highs both days in the 30s north to 40s and low
50s in the southern zones.

But the upper low opens up late Saturday and an upper trough takes
over and brings a cold front through the CWA late Saturday.
Leftover moisture from the upper low and dynamics with the upper
trough will bring a period or periods of snow from Saturday Night
through Sunday Night. 2 to 4 inches can be expected with the
greatest in SW Philips county, the least is expected in the NE
zones (Sheridan County). It`s a bit early to issue an advisory
for this, so we will be messaging this on Social Media for now.

Afterwards, cold air will move into the area. Mainly dry
conditions are expected Monday but it`ll be brisk. Things begin to
moderate mid-week, but temperatures are not expected to return
above normal till maybe late in the week. TFJ

.AVIATION...
Low clouds will gradually clear this evening as the current cold
airmass moves to our east. Mid and high level clouds tonight will
linger into Friday. Expect light and variable winds to become
South by Friday at speeds 10 kts or less. TFJ
