Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Goodland KS
412 PM MST Thu Dec 5 2019

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Sunday)
Issued at 225 PM MST Thu Dec 5 2019

Tonight...precipitation chances come to an end during this as an
upper trough and axis of 850-500mb moisture moves away from the
area. A mix of liquid and frozen precipitation is expected very
early this evening changing over to some snow showers mid evening as
temperatures fall into the low 30s. As discussed yesterday, we`ll
have to deal with widespread low clouds overnight. Model visibility
forecasts suggest freezing fog developing after midnight mainly west
of a line from around Trenton to Colby, Oakley and Leoti.
Visibilities below 1/2 mile possible in far eastern Colorado. Low
temperatures in the 20s.

Friday...broad upper ridge spreads over the plains states with
little if any cloudiness except near the surface where boundary
layer remains fairly saturated in the morning before decreasing in
the afternoon. For the overnight hours it saturates again mainly
east of the CO/KS border. This will make for a difficult temperature
forecast. At this time will stick with better performing bias
corrected temperature grids the past 5 days which support highs in
the low to mid 40s. Low temperatures in the low to upper 20s.

Saturday...NAM wants to hold onto the stratus east of the CO/KS
border during the day while the GFS does not, pretty typical.
Otherwise little if any cloudiness. High temperatures generally in
the 50s. I wont be surprised if these change as we may be
battling a colder airmass in the northeast and warmer airmass
moving in across the west. Low temperatures in the mid 20s to low
30s. With 4-5mb 3 hour pressure falls I loaded the slightly higher
consmos winds for the daytime period.

Sunday...an upper level trough and cold front move through the area
during the night. Before that happens we should see high
temperatures range from the low 50s to around 60. Some spotty snow
showers possible during the night and with a dry slot in the mid
levels spotty seems the best way to describe precipitation chances.
Low temperatures in the upper teens to mid 20s.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Thursday)
Issued at 225 PM MST Thu Dec 5 2019

Monday...some spotty showers possible in the morning before
atmosphere dries out in the afternoon behind the upper trough
passage. We`ll have some breezy to windy north winds through the
day. High temperatures in the mid 30s to around 40. Low temperatures
in the mid teens to near 20.

Tuesday...upper ridging is advertised to be approaching the area
ahead of a trough approaching the west coast. Dry conditions are
expected with high temperatures in the mid 30s to near 40. Low
temperatures in the mid to upper teens.

Wednesday...some moderation in temperature is expected as slowly
increasing 500mb heights approach the area. Currently advertising
high temperatures in the 40s with low temperatures in the teens.

Thursday...a weak upper trough is expected to move across the area.
No weather is expected with high temperatures only in the mid 30s.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Friday evening)
Issued at 409 PM MST Thu Dec 5 2019

Low clouds and fog are expected to impact both KGLD and KMCK this
evening through Friday morning, then returning to VFR early Friday
afternoon. Surface winds are northwest to start, but then become
light and variable later tonight. Confidence best in the lower
ceilings, with lower confidence in fog developing due to the
downslope component in the surface winds. Lowest flight
categories expected to occur around 12z Friday morning, with a
few hours of IFR or VLIFR possible.
