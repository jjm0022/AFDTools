DISCUSSION...
West winds are picking up across the area this afternoon ahead of
a cold front that will move through the area tonight. Isolated low
end advisory level winds are being seen across the area but will
be too brief to issue an advisory as they will be diminishing
shortly. The High Wind Warning in the Guadalupe Mountains will
remain in effect however for the next several hours since winds in
the higher elevations are quite a bit stronger.

Temperatures behind the front will be cooler, but still above
normal and combined with dry conditions will allow for a very
pleasant weekend. Clouds increase Monday ahead of the next front
due on Monday night keeping temps slightly cooler. The ECMWF and
Canadian models are showing precipitation developing along and
just behind the front as the rear entrance region of an upper jet
max enhances lift across the Permian Basin which looks reasonable
though the GFS is noticeably drier. Most of the area will be too
warm for wintry precip though it could be close in the northern
basin. Have kept the weather grids all rain for now but there is
potential for slick conditions developing from Hobbs to Snyder
early Tuesday that will have to be monitored. Precip ends during
the day on Tuesday, which will be the coldest day of the week,
followed by warmer temps Wed/Thu.
