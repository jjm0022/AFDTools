Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Boston/Norton MA
443 PM EST Thu Dec 5 2019

.SYNOPSIS...
Tonight, any snow showers in Western MA and far northwest CT
will gradually diminish. Under clear skies, light winds and a
deep snowpack (some parts of interior MA and CT still have snow
depth over a foot), expect temperatures to drop into the teens
in the interior and 20s elsewhere. Tomorrow, clouds will
increase ahead of a fast-moving clipper system that will push
through with periods of light snow in the afternoon and early
evening. Best chance of seeing light accumulations would be
along and north of the MA turnpike. The East Slopes of the
Berkshires could see upwards of 2 inches. Colder, drier air
moves in Friday night and Saturday as high pressure brings dry
weather for the weekend. The high moves offshore Sunday,
starting a return flow of milder air for the first half of the
week. Parts of the area could even reach 60 degrees by Tuesday.
However, this would be accompanied by a widespread rain event
from Sunday night through Tuesday. A cold front moves through
Tuesday night, followed by a return to cooler temperatures for
Wednesday.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...
Tonight...

Light snow was briefly reported in Pittsfield and radar has
picked up on some reflectivity in northwest CT but in general,
snow has not made it to the ground east of the Berkshires.
Nonetheless, have introduced a slight chance for snow showers
west and along the CT River valley. Otherwise, clouds will
gradually clear out this evening. Helped by a fresh snowpack,
radiational cooling will drop lows into the upper teens and low
20s for Western and Central MA. Mid 20s are expected for other
locations with the exception of Cape and the Islands, which
should bottom out in the upper 20s and low 30s.

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...
Friday ...
***A CLIPPER SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO BRING COATING TO AN INCH OF
 SNOW ESPECIALLY ALONG & NORTH OF THE MA TURNPIKE LATE FRI
 AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING. LOCALLY 2-3 INCHES POSSIBLE IN
 THE EAST SLOPES OF THE BERKSHIRES.***

Clouds overspread the entire area from west to east by mid
morning. A progressive clipper system is expected to bring a
period of light snow late afternoon into the early evening
hours. There appear to be two areas of good 700-850mb jet
dynamics, one near the Berkshires and the other along south
coast. However, 925mb temperatures look to be above freezing
south of the MA turnpike so not expecting accumulations except
coating on grassy surfaces there. North of the turnpike,
however, temperatures might be cold enough to support up to an
inch of snow. Towards the Berkshires, where there is a
combination of good dynamics and sub-freezing temperatures, up
to 2 to 3 inches of snow are possible in the higher elevations.
Confidence for 3 inches of snow is currently low, however, so
have opted to issue a Special Weather Statement instead of a
Winter Weather Advisory. Snow will quickly come to an end west
to east by around 10pm so mid-level dry air moves in and shuts
off the precipitation. In summary, most locations will likely
see under an inch of snow but given that the snow would likely
overlap with parts of evening commute, motorists should be
aware of slippery travel.

After the snow exits, skies would gradually clear overnight.
The extent of radiational cooling will depend on how quickly the
winds decouple. There might be a short window before sunrise
where temperatures can fall quickly. So right now, looking at
mid to upper teens for much of interior MA and low to mid 20s
elsewhere except for low 30s on the Cape.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
Highlights...

Dry through the weekend with unseasonably cold temperatures on
Saturday and Sunday AM. Temperatures rebounding on Sunday.

Rain spreading in early next week with temperatures trending upward.
Potential for strong winds on Monday and Tuesday.

Cooler temperatures return on Wednesday.

Daily Concerns...

Saturday and Sunday...

Cyclonic flow on Saturday with a trough lifting northeast of the
region. Good agreement between deterministic models with cold
northwesterly flow aloft. Mid level ridge building into the eastern
Great Lakes. The surface response will be high pressure building
just to the west of New England. Am a bit skeptical on the current
sky forecast given the upper level pattern. Typically with cyclonic
flow, cold air advection and day time heating there is more in the
way of diurnal cu, but opted to leaned on the consensus amongst
guidance which keeps it sunny. Something to keep in mind for future
updates to the forecast. High temperatures range from the upper 20s
across the higher elevations in western and central MA to the mid
30s along the coast. Moderate to high confidence in the forecast.

High pressure builds in over New England Saturday evening into early
Sunday. This will bring clear skies and light winds. Expect strong
radiational cooling due to this setup. Bumped down temperatures
toward the 10th percentile of guidance which brings low temperatures
into the single digits above zero across the MA/CT/NH border. Low
temperatures elsewhere will generally be in the teens, but it will
be slightly warmer along the coast with lows in the low to mid 20s.
High confidence in the forecast.

High pressure shifts to the east as the day progresses on Sunday.
Winds aloft will shift to a southwesterly direction and advect warm
air into the region. Skies will be partly to mostly sunny with highs
rebounding into the mid 30s along the MA/NH/VT border and the low
40s across the coast and SE MA. High confidence in the forecast.

Sunday evening through Wednesday...

Pattern change beginning late on Sunday through the middle of next
week. Shifting from a zonal pattern to a more amplified pattern. A
positively tilted trough will dig from the Pacific Northwest Sunday
evening into the Central Plains by Monday evening. There are still
some differences between the GFS and ECMWF/GEM. The ECMWF/GEM
feature a northern and southern stream trough where the weaker
southern trough lags over the Southwestern US and the northern
becomes nearly neutrally tilted over the Central US. The GFS quickly
absorbs the southern stream trough. This does not have major
implications on how things evolve other than the GFS developing a
deeper low than than ECMWF/GEM over the central Great Lakes late on
Monday into Tuesday. The overall progression of the system is in
good agreement through Tuesday. The low lifts from the central Great
Lakes into eastern Ontario and Quebec. This keeps New England in
storm warm air advection and anticipate that precipitation will
remain all rain. There could be some snow mixing in across western
MA as colder air filters in as things wind down late on Tuesday into
early Wednesday. Still concerned about winds and wind gusts on
Monday and Tuesday with a 40 to 60 kt 925 hpa low level jet
developing. Held off from bumping winds up due to some disagreement
between the ECMWF and GFS where the jet sets up, but may need to do
so in future updates. Not out of the question that there are a few
rumbles of thunder Monday into Tuesday.

Temperatures will be warm on Monday and Tuesday due to the strong
warm air advection. High temperatures will generally be in the 50s.
Think there is a possibility for some 60 degree readings if strong
winds develop and we tap into the mixed layer. Cooler temperatures
return on Wednesday as the system lifts into Quebec. Flow will
become northwesterly advecting cold air into the region. Highs on
Wednesday drop into the low 30s across the Berkshires and the low
40s along the coast and SE MA. Low to medium confidence in the
forecast.
